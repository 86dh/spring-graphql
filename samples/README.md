This directory contains samples that we run to test different scenarios and features. 

All samples use the Boot starter and expose a GraphiQL page where you can run queries. Simply start the `main` application class and go to http://localhost:8080/graphiql. 

To run from the command line, use:
```shell script
$ ./gradlew :samples:{sample-directory-name}:bootRun
```

Samples have integration tests you can run with a debugger.
